  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept on trying when I was figuring out which code would work when one piece was not working.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself "which piece of code I could reuse or make more easier to read."</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I fixed a piece of code on my own without having to ask for help.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought to when the teacher was giving the instructions and I made a decision to change the waiting time and the ship speed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to the instruction when the teacher was talking about how to make the aliens move.</td>

    <td>I could have listened more to the teacher and could have processed what I was going to do before randomly changing bits of code.               </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
