    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept on changing some code to make an alien duplicate and at the third attempt I succeeded.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself by asking myself if changing the costumes into the script would do anything.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my own and when I did not understand things I read through things myself and did not ask anyone to help me to understand or show me what to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought back to last lesson when I forgot that the laser needed to be straight and in the middle of page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to what the teacher had said and used all of the resources given to me and that were available for me to use (the powerpoint, the link of the image to upload and the worksheet).</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

    <td>I could have understood the code a bit more rather than rushing and not thinking about what it could mean.</td>

    <td>I need to understand the code a bit more and I can do this by slowing down and processing the information in my head rather than rushing through work.</td>
